This is supplementary data 2 in split format:
Each file represents a pair of variables. The directory contains 5989 pairs.

The files CEdata_train_publicinfo.csv and CEdata_train_target.csv contain information and target values for the variables.

This dataset includes mixed type variables (numerical --continuous or discrete--, categorical, and binary). The numerical variables were normalized to mean 0 and standard deviation 10000 then rounded to the nearest integer. The number of unique values and number of samples are balanced across the classes.
